{"faq":{"java-rotation":"Minecraft Block/Item model rotations are limited by the format to one axis at a time and increments of 22.5°.","java-culling":"Minecraft hides (culls) the faces between solid blocks to improve performance. To avoid this, remodel a non-solid block. For example: Glass, Pressure Plates, Flowers.\nAlternatively, display the model by putting it into the head slot of an invisible Armor Stand.","obj":"Blockbench is a modeling program that is limited to boxes. Therefore it cannot import the usually far more complex OBJ models.","java-sizelimit":"Java block and item models are limited to this size by the format. To display those models larger in game, go to the display tab and use the scale slider to scale the model up. Then display it in the head or hand slot of an invisible armor stand in game.","animation":"**Bedrock Edition:** Models can be animated using the animation tab in the top right corner\n**Vanilla Java Edition:** Java block and item models don't support animations natively. There is a trick to use animated textures to simulate movement, but its options are fairly limited. This video explains this trick in depth: <https://youtu.be/9EXrHIBD_2E>\n**OptiFine Entities:** Optifine entities support expression based animations. More info here: <https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/blob/master/OptiFineDoc/doc/cem_animation.txt>\n**Modded entities:** Modded entities can be animated manually through code but not in your modeling program\n**Free Models:** Models can be animated using the animation tab in the top right corner. The models can be exported along with animations using the export format glTF.","bedrock-smallcubes":"The size of cubes is floored for the UV map calculation. This means that any size smaller than 1 will result in a 0 pixel wide UV map, which will look glitchy. To prevent this make sure all of your cubes are at least 1 unit long in each direction. To create smaller cubes, use the Inflate slider.","sketchfab-blur":"To render textures pixelated in Sketchfab, go to the \"3D Settings\" of your model. Open the \"Materials\" tab and select your texture in the upper dropdown menu. In the \"PBR Maps\" section, click on the icon below \"Base Color\" and set \"Filtering\" to \"Nearest\". Save the settings and quit. Your textures will now display pixelated. Note that the size of textures must be a power of two to display correctly.","default-pack":"\nDisclaimer: Use these packs as **REFERENCE**, don't put your models inside them, it just increases your pack needlessly and the distributions of default assets in your pack would be illegal.\n\n**For Java Edition:** Go to `.minecraft/versions/1.14` and open the 1.14.jar in there with a zip program. Extract/copy the \"assets\" folder inside the jar somewhere.
